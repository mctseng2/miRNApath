Description: This package provides pathway enrichment techniques
   for miRNA expression data. Specifically, the set of
   methods handles the many-to-many relationship between miRNAs
   and the multiple genes they are predicted to target (and thus
   affect.)  It also handles the gene-to-pathway relationships
   separately. Both steps are designed to preserve the additive
   effects of miRNAs on genes, many miRNAs affecting one gene,
   one miRNA affecting multiple genes, or many miRNAs affecting
   many genes.
